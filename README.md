# Titanic Survival Prediction 🛳️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using machine learning.  
It was created as part of my **Data Science Internship Task**.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess Titanic dataset  
- Build a classification model (Logistic Regression)  
- Evaluate accuracy and make predictions  
- Create visual insights from the data  

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Joblib (Model Saving/Loading)

## 📊 Results
- Model Accuracy: ~80%  
- Female passengers and 1st-class travelers had higher survival rates.
