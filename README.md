# Titanic Survival Prediction 🛳️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using machine learning.  
It was created as part of my **Data Science Internship Task**.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess Titanic dataset  
- Build a classification model (Logistic Regression)  
- Evaluate accuracy and make predictions  
- Create visual insights from the data  

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Joblib (Model Saving/Loading)

## 📊 Results
- Model Accuracy: ~80%  
- Female passengers and 1st-class travelers had higher survival rates.

## 🚀 How to Run

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this project.  
2. Place `train.csv` in the same folder.  
3. Run: 
  # Step 1: Set up the environment (one time only)
  These commands make sure all Python libraries are installed correctly:
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Step 2: Run your project (any time)
 Once the environment is ready, they can run any of your .py files like this:
 venv\Scripts\activate
 python train_titanic.py
 python predict.py
 python visualize_titanic.py
 


# Check the `graphs` folder for visual results.  

## 🧩 Skills Learned
- Data Cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model Training & Evaluation  
- Python Automation  
- Data Visualization 

# If you ever move your project to another computer, just run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
That installs everything in one go!
